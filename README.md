If this is your first time here, run `python3 -m venv project-venv` to set up your virtual environment.

From now on every time you start this project run `source project-venv/bin/activate`.

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install everything you need.

If you add a new package, always save them to the requirements.txt file with `pip freeze >| requirements.txt`.

To leave the virtual environment type `deactivate`.
